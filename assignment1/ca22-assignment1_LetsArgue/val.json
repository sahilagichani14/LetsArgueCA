The stress on a uniform dress code in school opposes the spirit of unity in diversity and its celebration. It is even claimed to restrict socialization, a vital aspect of human nature."

Plastic water bottles should only be used in emergency purposes only. The water in those plastic are only filtered tap water. In an emergency situation like Katrina no one had access to tap water. In a situation like this water bottles are good because it provides the people in need. Other than that water bottles should not be legal because it pollutes the land and big companies get 1000% of the profit."
