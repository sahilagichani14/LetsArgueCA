of all , public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street . Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options . Apparently , a bus can carry no less than 30 people , while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number . Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground , which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles . Together , they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays . ","sufficient":true},{"text":"Second , rarely do we realize the helpful existence of urban areas . It is believed that if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt , the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now . As a rule of thumb , huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities . The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people . ","sufficient":true}],"1":[{"text":"Firstly , some people suggest that qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer . It is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job . Specifically , people who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience . Social skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery . ","sufficient":false},{"text":"On the other hand , it is no doubt that the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers . It is because people nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently . Interpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other , especially when conflicts arise . Better social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way . Besides , organization have been transformed to customers oriented . Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction . ","sufficient":true}],"2":[{"text":"First of all , there is no doubt that governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way . Admittedly , no one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health , education , transportation and communication . However , these could only help individuals with their physical requirements . There is also a burden on the government to highly concern about the people mental health initiatives which would be unconsciously or sensibly provided by the arts . ","sufficient":true},{"text":"On top of this , the arts play a pivotal role in all-round development of a society . No developed country could be named that music , painting , literature and other fields of arts are out of its government consideration . Enriching people ' s life and enlightening their thoughts , the arts basically affect the enhancement of societies in many positive ways . ","sufficient":true},{"text":"Furthermore , investing in art could bring employment opportunities and could end in return of capital occasionally . The investment could be paid back through the values of the created works of art which as a matter of fact should be considered as national possessions . ","sufficient":true}],"3":[{"text":"First , the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation . Cars depend on gasoline , which is a non-renewable resource . Therefore , the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up . In the contrary , if the public transportation is efficiently used , the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower . And this definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource , gasoline . ","sufficient":true},{"text":"Second , public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems . Averagely , public transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars . It means that by using public transports , the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads , which is always full of fumes . ","sufficient":true},{"text":"Last but not least , using public transportation is much safer than private transportation . According to National Safety Council , riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care . Thus there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation , a healthy , safe and economical way of transporting . ","sufficient":true}],"4":[{"text":"Firstly , most people ' s lives are filled with tasks that they don ' t enjoy doing . In personal live , we have some responsibilities towards to other people , there is nobody who likes all of these responsibilities . For instance , housework is very difficult for me , although my husband helps me some of them , but it is my responsibility . I really don ' t like any of them , however I should do . ","sufficient":false},{"text":"Secondly , professional lives are filled with tasks that is neccessary parts of the jobs . Nobody likes attending boring conferences , or working a person who isn ' t well in with anyone . I ' m a research asistant at a university , and as any of the univesity in ours we have a professor who isn ' t good at human relationships , most of the asistans don ' t enjoy to talk with him about any situation , although we have to ask about his field . ","sufficient":false},{"text":"Thirdly , doing something which an individual doesn ' t enjoy can led to enjoyment . People sometimes can attend any activities by insisting on any of their friends although they don ' t really want . For example , one of our friends tell my husband and me about a dance course which we both don ' t like . After insisting on some of our friends , we attended , and got really enjoyable time , we continued the course about six months although most of our friends left the course after a month . ","sufficient":false}],"5":[{"text":"When pupils make a group for studying , all member of group have the same chance to help each other . They can work together for understanding the complicated aspect of a course . For example , when a group faces with complex math problem , they can share their opinions to solve it . In addition , such a remarkable effect has incorporation that all students can improve their weak points in a group . ","sufficient":false},{"text":"Increasing the motivation and competence spirit are another benefit of group-studying . In a group of student , the best of those always encourages others to study harder . Besides , pupils often have a tangible competence in order that they can get the highest grade in a group . Clearly , better learning is one of noticeable result of these competences and encouragements . ","sufficient":true},{"text":"When the students study with their friends , they should have schedule to use their time in an effective manner . Group-studying causes some kind of internal obligation to manage the time , inasmuch as we always care about other people and we do not want to waste their time . Therefore , time management is another brilliant benefit of group-studying . ","sufficient":true}],"6":[{"text":"Firstly , capital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture . Crimes kill someone which is illegal ; nevertheless , the government use law to punish them , which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one . As a fact that the criminal is repeated second time ; also , it is regarded as the \" legalized revenge \" to victims ' family . Hence , death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture . ","sufficient":true},{"text":"Secondly , nobody has the right to take another human life . It is undeniable that the rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being . No one has the right to take the life of a human ; even if he committed murder . If you kill a criminal , you become a criminal . Moreover , if we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem , it is neither unethical nor immoral . In short , crimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment . ","sufficient":true},{"text":"Finally , with some of serious criminals , capital punishment is an easy way out . Criminals should be punished for their misdeeds . If they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins , it is so easy for them . They do not undergo any pain or misery . Why do not we have other wisely punishments ? As we can see some industries such as mining , oil and gas extraction , reclamation , etc , needs many labors . Why do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country - it is better . Moreover , rehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts . ","sufficient":true}],"7":[{"text":"To begin with , studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems . For example , in math class , the way that we learnt to find an answer by doing step by step . Start with find cause of problem and the way to do research to solve the problem . I could adapt this method to use my real life . When I want to go to somewhere , I try to find the way to reach to destination . Which ways are shortest and which ways are less consume my time . I could find a better way to solve problems . ","sufficient":true},{"text":"Secondly , Some experiences could teach me the way to take care of myself . For instance , reading and listening the news about choosing a good diet are the way to keep myself are more healthy . Thus , I am always buy a quality food such as organic food . This food are not have chemical . So that , I can have a good health . This experience teach me to aware my health . ","sufficient":false},{"text":"Lastly , experiences are also change to plan for my future life . For example , I read about saving money for my retire is a good plan for my life . Consequently , I start changing myself from spending many thing that I want to saving money for my entire life . This experience change me to concern about making plan for my future life . ","sufficient":true}],"8":[{"text":"For one thing , making a quick decision means that it ' s not very thought out , and that it hasn ' t been checked from all its aspects . Consequently , making quick decisions leads to probable bad results . For example : if someone decided to quit his job without really thinking about the alternative , or a plan B , he could end up being unemployed , because of his speedy decision . ","sufficient":false},{"text":"In addition , making a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity . In another word , if this person had waited and thought his decision through he wouldn ' t have missed out on the job opening in the same firm , but at a different position . Hence , he wouldn ' t have been unemployed . ","sufficient":true},{"text":"Not to mention , that hasty decisions , not only goes to waste , but also , could affect the entire life of the person . To put it differently , is that after this person has quit his job and became unemployed , he can no longer pay his bills nor buy what he needs for his everyday needs , thus , his life had taken a turn to the worst . ","sufficient":true}],"9":[{"text":"Firstly , rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world . The so-called Concrete jungles have evolved endangering forests and wild life . As we all know life saving oxygen is produced by trees after converting harmful carbon dioxide gas . Moreover , wild life is very essential to maintain ecological balance on planet Earth . ","sufficient":true},{"text":"Secondly , large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer . Importance of ozone layer is evident by the fact as it protects us from harmful ultra violet rays . To add to it , excess emission of carbon dioxide gas mainly by vehicles around the world has increased the average temperature at north pole which in turn has increased water level due to gradual melting of glaciers . ","sufficient":true},{"text":"Lastly , either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth . For instance a large amount of unnoticed industrial waste released in oceans effects aquatic life to a large extent . Harmful chemicals present in industrial waste kills lot of sea creatures in oceans or rivers . ","sufficient":false}],"10":[{"text":"First of all , poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer . To be out of poverty , it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light , electricity , load , highways , natural resources , technology and buildings for companies . Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business . In actual , republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960 ' s . Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties . ","sufficient":false},{"text":"Secondly , aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people . If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases , they would never take their abundance for granted . It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love , but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization . ","sufficient":true},{"text":"Third , the campaigns might include practical benefits . In globalized world , the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others . When America mortgage loan system went bad , several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated , even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt . ","sufficient":false}],"11":[{"text":"On the one hand , I agree that a police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun . An obvious example of this happens in The United State , a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon , while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him . Obviously , police officers can force a criminal to surrender , because they have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public . As a result , some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence . ","sufficient":false},{"text":"On the other hand , there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities . Firstly , the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries . Many well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably . Secondly , cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive , so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs . Many baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport , for instance . ","sufficient":false}],"12":[{"text":"To begin with , telephones and email help people , who live far away from other people , to connect each other . Unlike email , send message by using mail service could be lost and could be sent to wrong address . I can using telephones and email to talk or write directly to people I want to connect with . For example , right now , I am in the U . S . It is not possible to have conversation in person with my parents , who live in my country . Consequently , I can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want . Telephones and email made me feel close to my parents . ","sufficient":false},{"text":"Second , using telephones and email could express some important words better than face-to-face communication . For instant , sometime when I argue with my friends , I cannot express my self to my friends at that moment . So , when I have a time to realize what had happened , I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion . Thus , these types of communications make me feel personal . ","sufficient":false}],"13":[{"text":"First , the core of group working is \" consensus \" . It ' s the idea that everyone \u0089\u00db\u00aa s opinion accounts . In group works , group members gather together to have brain-storming discussion , think over every possible solutions and then finally reach an agreement . In this long process of discussion , there must be different opinions sparkling out . It doesn ' t work if one member solely insists on his \/ her idea and doesn ' t take other member ' s criticism because the work belongs to every member , not a personal show for specific one member . It ' s every member ' s duty to respect other ' s opinion . ","sufficient":true},{"text":"Second , taking criticism is a virtue as you take someone ' s opinion that is against you . Even if you are not working in a group , you still need to take others ' criticism . Criticism definitely hurts because it points out your drawbacks and forces you to confront them . However , criticism can help you detect those drawbacks and fix them if you are willing to take it . Those who don ' t even take a word of criticism will eventually lose chances to get improved . In other words , if you can ' t take any criticism , not only will you fail in cooperating with other people , but also get defeated in personal works . As one Chinese idiom goes : \" The good medicine tastes bitter \" . Criticism might be the most powerful solution to heal . ","sufficient":true},{"text":"However , some people might ask : what if the criticism proves to be wrong ? What if that I was at first right but the seemingly reasonable criticism led me to the wrong direction ? Doesn ' t insistence also a good character ? In my point of view , even if you are right , criticism is still helpful because in this case it not only is a fixer , but it also serves as a practice to test you how much you know about your work . Taking criticism doesn ' t necessary mean that you have to take it all . You should have your own judgments too ! And it ' s kind of art to make the best use of criticism . ","sufficient":true}],"14":[{"text":"First , living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health . If you are always hurried and you do not take a certain time off , your body will react to your stressful lifestyle . Many hardworking people have diseases , like the burn-out syndrome , because their bodies cannot hold the pace . For instance , my father had a a breakdown several years ago due to his stressful job . After several weeks off his body was restored , now he has reduced the tempo of his lifestyle and is doing fine . ","sufficient":false},{"text":"In addition , living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness . If you are always facing excessive stress you cannot care for your beloved ' s . If you do not hurry yourself you can take more time for your family and friends . Caring for your social environment will increase your happiness and also reduce your stress level . For example , a friend of mine lives at a slow pace and is really satisfied about it , because he can enjoy his family and cultivate his friendships . ","sufficient":false},{"text":"Finally , quality takes time . When you are faced with difficult tasks and you do them in a rush , you are more likely to do avoidable errors or mistakes . Doing tasks in a hurry may end up in not considering all necessary aspects or opportunities . As a result you might make mistakes , you would not have done with more patience . To illustrate , I once wrote an essay in a hurry and got a bad grade , because I made few mistakes I could have avoided . ","sufficient":false}],"15":[{"text":"First of all , many people think that college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students . The reason is that studying in advance education take a huge of money . College and university do not want people who not qualify for to waste their money in these expensive courses and waste their time . They believe that only good students have potentials to success programs more that those who are not considered as good students . Consequently , mediocre students are not have a chance to gain these advance knowledge from college and university . ","sufficient":true},{"text":"On the other hand , there are some people think that all students should have equal opportunity to study in higher education . Of course , higher education take a lot of money and a lot of time however moderate students should have a chance to try . Everyone that has strongly ambition could pursue and success their goal even they are not classified as a good student because people can change . With a good environment in college or university is encouraging students to study harder for a good future . Thus , mediocre students should have opportunity to be trained in college and university .

One of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town . Also , in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic . Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness . Moreover , in a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits .

Most of all , the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization , from children to adults . We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life , and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life . By making teamwork , the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others . As university students , it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others . After graduating from schools , employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits . Thus , almost of us live in the environment of groups .

A solid group can be a suited environment , which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons . For example , as a student majoring in mass media , I have taken part in mass media student group for a year .

Tzu Chi , a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan , is famous for contributing to the social and community services , and medical care . They bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit . For accomplishing their missions , the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks .

For example , monuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city ' s history and culture , but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists . In fact , some countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue , thus , the governments should help arts because their work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry .

In spite of bring fantastic advantages , technological products have devastated the natural environment indirectly through its production process .

As i had to spend some of my time in my job , therefore , i had to manage my time efficiently . I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework . This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively . Moreover , I learn money management .

Furthermore , researchers , especially those who work on high-tech , would have wider range of references if they are good at English .

To illustrate , every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland .

For example , some certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese , so the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers , facilities and appropriate materials .

If you believe in luck , you would be clueless about where you are heading . For example , a friend of mine , who had severe financial constraints , had the habit of buying lottery tickets thinking that one day he would win a lottery .

Although he had many commitments at home and work , he somehow managed to complete this degree before he was eligible to apply .

When she gets to the dorm , she is really full of energy and after taking a shower , she is ready to start a good day . As you see , she is doing exercise without spending a cent .

It is out of of the questioned that the persistence of learning a knowledge in the childhood is more than other period of lives .

Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects , the better they perform in academic areas . ","sufficient":true},{"text":"Finally , psychology knows two types of motivation . There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset . And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people . Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being . However , in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims .

Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public . Also , zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life .

This system is that at the corner of each district , the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee . Since bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses , it is a better form to protect environment than automobile . As for the latter point , the introduction of international laws can be also effective . For instance , there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only . Thus , these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution . ","sufficient":false}],"298":[{"text":"Living with a roommate saves me a lot of money . If you have roommates , you can split the rent and utilities among them . This means you can get more for less . For example , last year , I shared a room off-campus with my friend , and we decided to split the rent and heating bills into half : I was able to save about fifty dollars for heating , and two hundred dollars for rent monthly . I was able to save a lot of money by sharing wasted heating and rooms with my friend and splitting the bills . ","sufficient":false},{"text":"Apart from saving a lot of money , living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily . It is always easier to socialize when you have a lot of people around you . You can invite your roommates ' friends over to your room and have fun together .

Moreover , having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation . ","sufficient":true},{"text":"Secondly , students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones . By constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation , then students ' confidence could be significantly gained .

Indeed , high studying tuition , added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students .

Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals , it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in . Apparently , the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss . Moreover , if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period , it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures .

After two years in college I have found sometimes there is more differences between people than similarities , for we are growing in the different families and was educated in various ways . Sometimes acquaintances are just acquaintances . We spend time together but we could never be friend . So , it ' s much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends .

When my friend is sick , I would not only ask if he is okay like an acquaintance but do my best to make him get well as soon as possible . If my friend is going to the wrong direction in his life trail , I will try my best to pull him back , but not stand and stare like it ' s not of my business .

Therefore , we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives . ","sufficient":false},{"text":"Apart from the one I have mentioned above , another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy . If I can avoid being a sluggish person , I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully .

In short , it only fulfills the work itself which is rather worthless . It is our capability of work that we should improve rather than holding the belief in completing it .

This might be even more costly and time consuming than a neat completion of work at the start . ","sufficient":true},{"text":"Besides , when looking at this problem within a broader image . Some work cannot tolerate any mistakes at all , for instance , in official missions like the work done by NASA , a tiny mistake can be catastrophic .

For the same reason , you won ' t have a problem if you are the one who wants to play music , bring friends over , or study late at night . You set your own schedules .

The same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm .

Afterward , my uncle acquired a new service thanks to face-to face communication .

Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows , learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values .
